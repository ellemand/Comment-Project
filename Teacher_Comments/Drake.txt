 Drake was an invalueable part of the class this semester. His perserverance, diligence, and focus helped to create a rich learning environment and he is a role model for all of his peers. I hope he continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. He was hesitant to ask questions during the larger class discussions and also didn't work well in small groups with his peers. Although not a requirement, engaging in discussions both large and small is an important part of our class, and is one of the best ways to grasp a firm understanding of the different concepts. I hope to see Drake participate more next semester. Drake took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Drake did an excellent job with this semesters tests, averaging 90.5%. Drake started the year off strong but has trailed off in the second quarter (averaging 92.5% on first quarter tests and 88.5% on second quarter tests). Maintaining effort throughout the course will reap long term benefits for Drake. Drake, your grade for the semester is a B+. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
