This semester in Comp. Sci. Python, through a project-based approach, students worked towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language. Over the semester, students learned Python syntax, data types, program organization, algorithm design, and control structures. However, the primary goal for this class was for students to be able to develop efficient, readable algorithms and debug code when necessary. Ethan was an invalueable part of the class this semester. His humor, collaboration, and work ethic helped to create a rich learning environment and he is a role model for all of his peers. I hope he continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. He is comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussions and also works well in small groups with his peers. His willingness to participate in both group and class activities helped make the learning process a little easier for the rest of the class. Ethan took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Ethan did an excellent job with this semesters tests, averaging 90.75%. Ethan has been working hard since day 1 and always comes prepared for class. I hope he continues to motivate himself and keeps the same level of focus in the second semester.
