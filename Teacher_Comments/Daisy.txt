 Daisy was an invalueable part of the class this semester. Her encouraging nature, diligence, and collaboration helped to create a rich learning environment and she is a role model for all of her peers. I hope she continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. She was hesitant to ask questions during the larger class discussions and also didn't work well in small groups with her peers. Although not a requirement, engaging in discussions both large and small is an important part of our class, and is one of the best ways to grasp a firm understanding of the different concepts. I hope to see Daisy participate more next semester. Daisy took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Daisy did an excellent job with this semesters tests, averaging 91.0%. Daisy has been working hard since Day 1 and always comes prepared for class. I hope she continues to motivate herself and keeps the same level of focus in the second semester. Daisy, your grade for the semester is an A-. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
