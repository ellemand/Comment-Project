 Aashna was an invalueable part of the class this semester. Her focus, collaboration, and perserverance helped to create a rich learning environment and she is a role model for all of her peers. I hope she continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. She was hesitant to ask questions during the larger class discussions but worked well in small groups with her peers. Aashna is a bit on the quiet side, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I hope to hear her voice a little more during our big discussions. Aashna took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Aashna did a good job with this semesters tests, averaging 88.75%. Aashna has been working hard since Day 1 and always comes prepared for class. I hope she continues to motivate herself and keeps the same level of focus in the second semester. Aashna, your grade for the semester is a B+. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
