 Kim was an invalueable part of the class this semester. His natural ability, perserverance, and encouraging nature helped to create a rich learning environment and he is a role model for all of his peers. I hope he continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. He was hesitant to ask questions during the larger class discussions and also didn't work well in small groups with his peers. Although not a requirement, engaging in discussions both large and small is an important part of our class, and is one of the best ways to grasp a firm understanding of the different concepts. I hope to see Kim participate more next semester. Kim took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Kim did an excellent job with this semesters tests, averaging 93.75%. Kim has been working hard since Day 1 and always comes prepared for class. I hope he continues to motivate himself and keeps the same level of focus in the second semester. Kim, your grade for the semester is an A. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
