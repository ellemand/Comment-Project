 Kanye was an invalueable part of the class this semester. His rapping, producing, and eating helped to create a rich learning environment and he is a role model for all of his peers. I hope he continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. He was hesitant to ask questions during the larger class discussions and also didn't work well in small groups with his peers. Although not a requirement, engaging in discussions both large and small is an important part of our class, and is one of the best ways to grasp a firm understanding of the different concepts. I hope to see Kanye participate more next semester. Kanye took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Kanye has struggled with testing this semester, averaging 63.75%. Kanye started the year off strong but has trailed off in the second quarter (averaging 65.0% on first quarter tests and 62.5% on second quarter tests). Maintaining effort throughout the course will reap long term benefits for Kanye. Kanye, your grade for the semester is a C-. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
