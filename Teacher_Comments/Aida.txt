 Aida was an invalueable part of the class this semester. Her collaboration, diligence, and natural ability helped to create a rich learning environment and she is a role model for all of her peers. I hope she continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. She was hesitant to ask questions during the larger class discussions and also didn't work well in small groups with her peers. Although not a requirement, engaging in discussions both large and small is an important part of our class, and is one of the best ways to grasp a firm understanding of the different concepts. I hope to see Aida participate more next semester. Aida took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Aida did a good job with this semesters tests, averaging 81.0%. Aida has been working hard since Day 1 and always comes prepared for class. I hope she continues to motivate herself and keeps the same level of focus in the second semester. Aida, your grade for the semester is a B. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
