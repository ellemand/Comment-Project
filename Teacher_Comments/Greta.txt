 Greta was an invalueable part of the class this semester. Her humor, diligence, and work ethic helped to create a rich learning environment and she is a role model for all of her peers. I hope she continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. She was hesitant to ask questions during the larger class discussions but worked well in small groups with her peers. Greta is a bit on the quiet side, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I hope to hear her voice a little more during our big discussions. Greta took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Greta did a good job with this semesters tests, averaging 88.0%. Greta started the year off strong but has trailed off in the second quarter (averaging 89.5% on first quarter tests and 86.5% on second quarter tests). Maintaining effort throughout the course will reap long term benefits for Greta. Greta, your grade for the semester is a B+. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
