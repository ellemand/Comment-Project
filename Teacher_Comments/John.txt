 John was an invalueable part of the class this semester. His diligence, focus, and humor helped to create a rich learning environment and he is a role model for all of his peers. I hope he continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. He is comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussions but had a hard time working in small groups with his peers. Next semester, I hope John continues to ask questions in larger discussions and starts to bring the same energy to the smaller group discussions. John took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. John did a good job with this semesters tests, averaging 82.5%. John started the year off strong but has trailed off in the second quarter (averaging 91.0% on first quarter tests and 74.0% on second quarter tests). Maintaining effort throughout the course will reap long term benefits for John. John, your grade for the semester is a C+. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
