This semester in Comp. Sci. Python, through a project-based approach, students worked towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language. Over the semester, students learned Python syntax, data types, program organization, algorithm design, and control structures. However, the primary goal for this class was for students to be able to develop efficient, readable algorithms and debug code when necessary.
