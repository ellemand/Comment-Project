 Kara was an invalueable part of the class this semester. Her work ethic, focus, and perserverance helped to create a rich learning environment and she is a role model for all of her peers. I hope she continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. She is comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussions and also works well in small groups with her peers. Her willingness to participate in both group and class activities helped make the learning process a little easier for the rest of the class. Kara took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Kara did a good job with this semesters tests, averaging 87.0%. Kara has been working hard since Day 1 and always comes prepared for class. I hope she continues to motivate herself and keeps the same level of focus in the second semester. Kara, your grade for the semester is a B+. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
