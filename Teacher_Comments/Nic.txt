 Nic was an invalueable part of the class this semester. His work ethic, focus, and diligence helped to create a rich learning environment and he is a role model for all of his peers. I hope he continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. He was hesitant to ask questions during the larger class discussions and also didn't work well in small groups with his peers. Although not a requirement, engaging in discussions both large and small is an important part of our class, and is one of the best ways to grasp a firm understanding of the different concepts. I hope to see Nic participate more next semester. Nic took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Nic did a good job with this semesters tests, averaging 89.25%. Nic has been working hard since Day 1 and always comes prepared for class. I hope he continues to motivate himself and keeps the same level of focus in the second semester. Nic, your grade for the semester is a B+. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
