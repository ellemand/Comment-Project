 Ethan was an invalueable part of the class this semester. His humor, collaboration, and work ethic helped to create a rich learning environment and he is a role model for all of his peers. I hope he continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. He is comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussions and also works well in small groups with his peers. His willingness to participate in both group and class activities helped make the learning process a little easier for the rest of the class. Ethan took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Ethan did an excellent job with this semesters tests, averaging 90.75%. Ethan has been working hard since Day 1 and always comes prepared for class. I hope he continues to motivate himself and keeps the same level of focus in the second semester. Ethan, your grade for the semester is an A-. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
