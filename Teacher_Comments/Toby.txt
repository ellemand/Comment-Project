 Toby was an invalueable part of the class this semester. His encouraging nature, collaboration, and diligence helped to create a rich learning environment and he is a role model for all of his peers. I hope he continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. He is comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussions and also works well in small groups with his peers. His willingness to participate in both group and class activities helped make the learning process a little easier for the rest of the class. Toby took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Toby did a good job with this semesters tests, averaging 85.75%. Toby started the year off strong but has trailed off in the second quarter (averaging 87.0% on first quarter tests and 84.5% on second quarter tests). Maintaining effort throughout the course will reap long term benefits for Toby. Toby, your grade for the semester is a B+. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
