 Eric was an invalueable part of the class this semester. His diligence, natural ability, and humor helped to create a rich learning environment and he is a role model for all of his peers. I hope he continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. He was hesitant to ask questions during the larger class discussions but worked well in small groups with his peers. Eric is a bit on the quiet side, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I hope to hear his voice a little more during our big discussions. Eric took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Eric did an excellent job with this semesters tests, averaging 93.25%. Eric has been working hard since Day 1 and always comes prepared for class. I hope he continues to motivate himself and keeps the same level of focus in the second semester. Eric, your grade for the semester is an A-. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
