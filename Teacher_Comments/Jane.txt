 Jane was an invalueable part of the class this semester. Her collaboration, humor, and perserverance helped to create a rich learning environment and she is a role model for all of her peers. I hope she continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. She is comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussions but had a hard time working in small groups with her peers. Next semester, I hope Jane continues to ask questions in larger discussions and starts to bring the same energy to the smaller group discussions. Jane took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Jane did an excellent job with this semesters tests, averaging 90.25%. Jane has been working hard since Day 1 and always comes prepared for class. I hope she continues to motivate herself and keeps the same level of focus in the second semester. Jane, your grade for the semester is a B+. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
