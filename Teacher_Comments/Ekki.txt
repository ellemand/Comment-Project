 Ekki was an invalueable part of the class this semester. Her encouraging nature, perserverance, and focus helped to create a rich learning environment and she is a role model for all of her peers. I hope she continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. She is comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussions but had a hard time working in small groups with her peers. Next semester, I hope Ekki continues to ask questions in larger discussions and starts to bring the same energy to the smaller group discussions. Ekki took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Ekki did an excellent job with this semesters tests, averaging 93.0%. Ekki has been working hard since Day 1 and always comes prepared for class. I hope she continues to motivate herself and keeps the same level of focus in the second semester. Ekki, your grade for the semester is an A. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
