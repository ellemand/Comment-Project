 Clyde was an invalueable part of the class this semester. His collaboration, humor, and work ethic helped to create a rich learning environment and he is a role model for all of his peers. I hope he continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. He was hesitant to ask questions during the larger class discussions but worked well in small groups with his peers. Clyde is a bit on the quiet side, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I hope to hear his voice a little more during our big discussions. Clyde took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Clyde did a good job with this semesters tests, averaging 80.5%. Clyde started the year off strong but has trailed off in the second quarter (averaging 82.5% on first quarter tests and 78.5% on second quarter tests). Maintaining effort throughout the course will reap long term benefits for Clyde. Clyde, your grade for the semester is a B. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
