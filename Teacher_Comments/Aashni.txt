 Aashni was an invalueable part of the class this semester. Her natural ability, perserverance, and work ethic helped to create a rich learning environment and she is a role model for all of her peers. I hope she continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. She is comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussions but had a hard time working in small groups with her peers. Next semester, I hope Aashni continues to ask questions in larger discussions and starts to bring the same energy to the smaller group discussions. Aashni took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Aashni did a good job with this semesters tests, averaging 87.0%. Aashni started the year off strong but has trailed off in the second quarter (averaging 89.5% on first quarter tests and 84.5% on second quarter tests). Maintaining effort throughout the course will reap long term benefits for Aashni. Aashni, your grade for the semester is a B+. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
