 Maxine was an invalueable part of the class this semester. Her diligence, focus, and perserverance helped to create a rich learning environment and she is a role model for all of her peers. I hope she continues to bring the same energy into the next semester and continues to brighten our classroom. She is comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussions and also works well in small groups with her peers. Her willingness to participate in both group and class activities helped make the learning process a little easier for the rest of the class. Maxine took four tests this semester: two unit tests, a midterm, and a final exam. Maxine did a good job with this semesters tests, averaging 87.0%. Maxine started the year off strong but has trailed off in the second quarter (averaging 88.0% on first quarter tests and 86.0% on second quarter tests). Maintaining effort throughout the course will reap long term benefits for Maxine. Maxine, your grade for the semester is a B+. We look forward to your continued growth as a computer scientist next semester.
